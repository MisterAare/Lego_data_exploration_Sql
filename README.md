# Lego_data_exploration_Sql

The objective of this project is to delve into the dataset of Legos, conduct a thorough exploration and investigation, and apply data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights.

In this project, I will guide you through the process of creating a database for analytics using the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset. We will explore various real-world scenarios and use SQL to answer questions based on the data. Throughout the project, we will start with basic SQL queries and gradually tackle more complex problems by leveraging JOINS, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and WINDOW functions.

Here are the skills we will work on in this SQL project:

1. Creating a Database in SQL Server

2. Importing Files into a Database on MySQL using MySQL Command
3. SQL Joins
4. SQL Window Functions
5. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of the Rebrickable LEGO dataset using SQL provided valuable insights. The Technic and Star Wars themes had the highest number of parts, followed by Friends. The dataset showed a consistent increase in the annual number of parts released since 2013. The Common Era “21st century” had significantly more sets than the Age of Extremes “20th century”. Train-themed sets constituted approximately 5% of the sets created in the Common Era. The Friends theme was the most popular in 2023, with Gear and Books themes also having high numbers in specific years. The colour black was the most produced colour of LEGO parts. Overall, this analysis revealed trends in theme popularity, LEGO’s growth, and the significance of colours in sets. These insights provide a foundation for further exploration and decision-making within the LEGO world.
